# Scylla - WotLK Daily Tracker addon

Scylla is a World of Warcraft (Wrath of the Lich King Classic) addon designed to showcase instant overviews of essential in-game information for efficient planning.

The addon was built with scalability  in mind.
For now it requires a little bit of tinkering in the lua files to add your own tracked quests, but the goal is to turn it into an interface option.

Originally built this for my own use, but I hope to build on it if it reaches interest of more players.


## Features

Daily Quest Tracker: Never miss a daily with Scylla's clear display.
Instance Lockouts: Stay on top of your raid resets and dungeon availability.
Currency Overview: Effortlessly track emblems
Reputation Status: Monitor your reputation progress with key factions.
